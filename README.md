# Loan Approval Prediction

This project focuses on predicting loan approval using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is "loan_data_set.csv". The goal is to train different classifiers on the dataset and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including their gender, marital status, dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, etc. The target variable is whether the loan was approved or not.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. Additionally, the following libraries are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
git clone [Loan]

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd loan-approval-prediction


3. Make sure the dataset file "loan_data_set.csv" is placed in the project directory.

4. Run the Python script:
python loan_approval_prediction.py


5. The script will perform the following tasks:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset
   - Handle missing values and perform feature engineering
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Train and evaluate different classifiers (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors)

6. The accuracy of each classifier will be displayed in the console.
